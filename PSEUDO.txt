1. Within the f of generate markdown you want to put the pieces of the readme you want to dynamically create everytime
2. I want to ask a series of questions and generate a readme page from that:
    I want to ask for #Project-Title
    ## Description: motivation, why did you build this project, what problem, did it solve, 
    what did you learn
    ## Table of Contents 
    ## Installation: What are the steps required to install your project?
    ## Usage: Do you have a screenshot/gif/video if so put in this format- 
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
    ## Contributing Links to GitHub contributors
    ## License: ask to select one of the licenses
    ## Tests: 
    ## Additional Questions: What is your email address?
